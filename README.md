## [Transfer Learning for sentiment analysis in movie reviews](https://github.com/ritvik02/Natural-Language-Processing-Projects/tree/main/Transfer%20Learning%20for%20sentiment%20analysis%20in%20movie%20reviews)

Traditional approaches to sentiment analysis, ones that used n-grams sometimes worked well. However, these approaches did not understand English and therefore failed. In this notebook we use a language model and transfer the encoding knowledge to our model to help it understand English.
